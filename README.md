# DBRE_Assessment

Task 2.1: Docker Compose Setup
To set up two PostgreSQL instances (pg_master and pg_replica), weâ€™ll use Docker Compose.

docker-compose.yml

Explanation
pg_master: The main PostgreSQL instance, initialized with a sample database (testDB).
pg_replica: A replica instance configured to connect to the master and replicate data.
Volumes: Ensure persistence of database data even if containers are restarted.
Networks: Both services are connected via a custom network (pg_network).

Task 2.2: Database Creation and Schema Setup
We need to create a table named orders and populate it with sample data inside the pg_master.

master-init.sql
This script initializes the database schema and inserts sample rows into the orders table.

Testing

After running docker-compose up -d, you can connect to the pg_master database and verify that the table and data were created:

bash

  "docker exec -it pg_master psql -U master_user -d testDB"

Run:

sql query

   "SELECT * FROM orders;"
